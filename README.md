# U.S. States Game
This is a simple Python game that allows you to guess the names of U.S. states using the turtle graphics module and a CSV file containing state data. The game displays an image of a blank U.S. map and prompts you to enter the names of states. If you guess correctly, the state name will be displayed on the map. If you guess all 50 states correctly, you win the game! If you want to exit the game, you can enter "Exit" as your answer.

# Prerequisites
To run this game, you will need to have Python installed on your machine, as well as the following modules:
~~~
turtle: a Python module for drawing graphics
pandas: a powerful data manipulation library in Python
~~~
You can install these modules using pip by running the following commands in your terminal:
~~~
pip install turtle
pip install pandas
~~~

# How to Run the Game
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.   
  
<br>  
  
Make sure you have the:
~~~
50_states.csv 
~~~
file in the same directory as the:
~~~
main.py
~~~
  
<br>   

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the game files are located.  
  
<br> 

Run the:
~~~
main.py
~~~
 
* The game window will open, displaying the blank U.S. map.  
* Enter the names of the states one by one when prompted. If you guess correctly, the state name will be displayed on the map.  
* If you want to exit the game, enter "Exit" as your answer.  
* Once you have guessed all 50 states correctly or chosen to exit the game, the game will end, and the result will be displayed on the screen.  
* You can also check the:
~~~
states_to_learn.csv
~~~
file generated by the game, which will contain the names of the states that you didn't guess correctly.  

# Game Rules
* You can enter the state names in title case (e.g., "New York") or all caps (e.g., "NEW YORK").  
* If you enter a state name that is not valid, the game will not recognize it as a correct guess.  
* The game keeps track of the number of states you have guessed correctly out of 50 and displays it in the title of the game window.  
* If you guess all 50 states correctly, you win the game! A congratulatory message will be displayed on the screen.  
* If you want to exit the game before guessing all 50 states, you can enter "Exit" as your answer. 
* The game will save the names of the states you haven't guessed correctly to a CSV file called states_to_learn.csv for future reference.
